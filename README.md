# News Site Data Extraction Bot

## Overview

Our mission is to enable all people to do the best work of their livesâ€”the first act in achieving that mission is to help companies automate tedious but critical business processes. This RPA challenge showcases the ability to build a bot for purposes of process automation.

## ðŸŸ¢ The Challenge

This challenge involves automating the process of extracting data from a news site.

You should push your code to a **public** Github repo, and then use that repo to [create a Robocorp Control Room process](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/beginners-course-python/12-running-in-robocorp-cloud). The process should have a completed successful run before submission. Make sure to [write your files to the `/output` directory](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/beginners-course-python/9-collecting-the-results#saving-the-file-to-the-output-directory) so that they are visible in the artifacts list.

### The Source

You are free to choose from any general news website. Some examples include:

- [AP News](https://apnews.com/)
- [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/)
- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/)
- [Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/)
- [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/)
- [Yahoo News](https://news.yahoo.com/)

### Parameters

The process must handle three parameters via the Robocorp work item:

- **Search Phrase**
- **News Category/Section/Topic**
- **Number of Months for which you need to receive news**

    Example: 
    - 0 or 1 - only the current month
    - 2 - current and previous month
    - 3 - current and two previous months, and so on

These parameters can be defined within a configuration file but should ideally be provided via a [Robocloud workitem](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/robocorp_workitems/).

### The Process

The main steps:

1. Open the news site.
2. Enter the search phrase in the search field.
3. On the results page:
    - If possible, select a news category or section.
    - Choose the latest (i.e., newest) news.
4. Extract the following values:
    - Title
    - Date
    - Description
5. Store the extracted data in an Excel file:
    - Title
    - Date
    - Description (if available)
    - Picture filename
    - Count of search phrases in the title and description
    - Boolean indicating whether the title or description contains any amount of money
6. Download the news picture and specify the file name in the Excel file.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all news that falls within the required time period.

### Submission Checklist

1. **Quality Code**: Ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and well-architected. Follow [PEP8 compliance](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and employ [OOP principles](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
2. **Resiliency**: Ensure your architecture is fault-tolerant and can handle failures at both the application and website levels. Utilize [explicit waits](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html) and the [Robocorp wrapper browser for Selenium](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/browser_selenium/python.html).
3. **Best Practices**: Follow best RPA practices. Use proper [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) and appropriate [string formatting](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation) in your logs (Python 3.8+).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Robocorp Lab or Robocorp Code
- Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gbdeassis0407/RPA_Challenge.git
  ```
  2. Install the required libraries:
  - Copiar cÃ³digo
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## Usage
  Set up your Robocorp Control Room process following this guide.
  Define the parameters in a Robocloud work item.
- Run the process.
- Output
- The extracted data will be stored in an Excel file in the /output directory, along with the downloaded news pictures.
